#####What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?


Both hashes and arrays are collections of objects, yet **arrays** are ordered by an integer-index beginning with 0 and **hashes** are organized using unique keys (may be synbols, which begin with ```:```, strings, arrays, integers, floats, or another hash).
